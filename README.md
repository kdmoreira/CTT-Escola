**Escola**: The main purpose of this project was to introduce students to the creation of Web APIs with basic CRUD methods that allow us to store information about teachers, students, classes and courses. The assignment also emphasized a Code-First approach using Entity Framework Core. We used SQL Server as the management system. Postman and Swagger were also introduced as a means to interact with the API.
